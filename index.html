		<p>Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. 
			That show's called a pilot. Then they show that 
			show to the people who make shows, and on the 
			strength of that one show they decide if they're going 
			to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become 
			television programs. Some don't, become nothing.
